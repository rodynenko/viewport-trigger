# viewport-trigger
Perfomant, light library in pure JS to trigger callback when elements enter or leave viewport, using IntersectionObserver API

## Motivation
There are a lot of libraries which give you opportunity to trigger some actions when element enters and/or leaves viewport, but they use scroll's listeners and `getBoundingClientRect` calculations, which is not so efficient, because it force browser to synchronously calculate the style and layout ([link](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a#what-forces-layout--reflow)). [IntersectionObserver API](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/blob/master/explainer.md) lets you know when observed element enters or leaves the browserâ€™s viewport in more efficient way. It was introduced in Chrome 51, and now it's native for Firefox and Opera too.

## Install
```sh
# npm
npm i -S viewport-trigger 

# yarn
yarn add viewport-trigger
```

With module bundlers just use 
```javascript
// ES6
import ViewportTrigger from 'viewport-trigger';

// CommonJS
const ViewportTrigger = require('viewport-trigger');
```
Or include minified script before your scripts in `body` tag
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/viewport-trigger.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage
First of all, you need an observer with default options
```javascript
// create observer
const vt = new ViewportTrigger();
```
or with custom options (you can read about `rootMargin` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin))
```javascript
// create observer with custom options
const vt = new ViewportTrigger({
  rootMargin: '100px 0 100px 0'
});
```
Then add target to observe and events to trigger. ViewportTrigger handles two events: `enter` (target enters viewport) and `leave` (target leaves viewport)
```javascript
// add DOM element as target
const target = document.getElementById('target');
vt.observe(target);

// add events handlers
vt
  .on('enter', target, () => {
    console.log('target entered viewport');
   })
  .on('leave', target, () => {
    console.log('target left viewport');
  });
```

## Browser support
IntersectionObserver API is available in the [latest browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver). Use [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) to support others.
