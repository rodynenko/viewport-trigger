# viewport-trigger
Perfomant, light library in pure JS to trigger callback when elements enter or leave viewport, using IntersectionObserver API

## Motivation
There are a lot of libraries which give you opportunity to trigger some actions when element enters and/or leaves viewport, but they use scroll's listeners and `getBoundingClientRect` calculations, which is not so efficient, because it force browser to synchronously calculate the style and layout ([link](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a#what-forces-layout--reflow)). [IntersectionObserver API](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/blob/master/explainer.md) lets you know when observed element enters or leaves the browserâ€™s viewport in more efficient way. It was introduced in Chrome 51, and now it's native for Firefox and Opera too.

## Install
```sh
# npm
npm i -S viewport-trigger 

# yarn
yarn add viewport-trigger
```

## Browser support
IntersectionObserver API is available in the [latest browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver). Use [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) to support others.
